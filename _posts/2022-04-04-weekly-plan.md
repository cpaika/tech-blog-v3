## The Week: April 4th -> April 8th
### The Weekend
Had a great time boating at the Keys.  Had a navigation GPS this time, made a worlds difference.  Definetly recommend everyone give it a try.  Just be sure to bring some mineral sun screen!

### The Week Ahead
This is going to be a weird week:
* The rest of my team is in person this week for the first time since Covid
* I'm off on Thursday & Friday
* We'll be driving from Key Largo to Boulder on saturday
* Partner's family is visiting - they are on vacation, we aren't!

So it's just going to be weird.  There's no way around it.  At the end of the week, if I make it to Colorado and have gotten some work done I'll consider that a job well done.

### Focuses for the week
* Doing my daily pushups, with today being a rest day since my body clearly needs it from snorkelling
* Cultivate an obsession with Scala.  I've learned a few of it's secrets, there's so much more to go.
* Have fun at work.  As an IC I'm so lucky - I can have fun with my job.  I need to remember to cultivate that.

At the end of the week, if I made progress with my Scala ticket and had fun Thur/Fri that will have been a job well done.  

Stretch goal is to organize friends visiting me in Colorado.  See you at the end of the week!
