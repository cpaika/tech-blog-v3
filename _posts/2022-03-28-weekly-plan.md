### The Week: March 28th -> April 1st

This week is a critical one.  It feels like an inflection point, where I'm finally free of one attractor and about to speed towards another.  The key move when you are at an inflection point is to not go backwards, follow the curve towards the new.

#### Professional
The key is to gracefully finish the Kafka work, this morning, today.  So that in the planning meeting I'll be all ready to go to pickup new work and get started on something fresh.  Really excited for the fresh start, but I want to treat it with respect.  This is going to be challenging.  The best way I can face it is with calm respect.  This shift has been a long time coming.  If I can relax, embrace the difficulty of the challenge, and enjoy the difficulty - I will have considered that a job well done.

So the key to work is:
* Relax, be comfortable
* Play
* Cherish the challenge & opportunity

If the opportunity presents itself, I'll jump back into the Category Theory book and finish some challenges.

#### Personal
I have a goal to do five days of pushups today, which I'm going to hit.  My lovely life partner is doing them with me, I'm excited that I'm back to working out.

Otherwise, will focus on relaxing, drinking water, stretching occasionally.  Keeping the body healty.  Doing some writing when I feel like it, but not stressing myself out with deadlines.  I'll publish what I'll publish.  

I've been working on a theory of life force and how to cultivate higher agency, ideally I'd like to continue developing - however it may just be a weekend activity, when I have more space.  If the time is right, it'll happen.  

#### Summary
This week is professionally focused, however not to an extreme.  Say 60/40.  Working hours are the same, just the focus is on supporting my body and mind during a transition phase to different types of work.

I have faith that this week will get done well, see you all at the end of the week with a reflection.
