One of the thing's I've struggled with recently is deciding when something is ready to be put out in the world.  I have a certain level of perfection I like to hit - and when I'm busy working a stressful day job, most of my pursuits of love just don't have the time to become perfect. 

So here's a commitment to publishing unfinished work.  Be it writing, or art.  Make something, and release it.  Don't hold it back, don't edit it, just create and share.  My mantra for the year.
