So a couple short takeaways from spending time coding with GPT-4 on some personal projects

1. Holy crap this is fast.  I was able to parse a codebase into an Abstract Syntax Tree in only 30 minutes!
2. Scala is a great language, but it's not fast to iterate on with an LLM
3. Bummer you can only parse a language into an AST with the language itself - python doesn't have a great scala AST library obviously.
4. Microsoft is going to cleanup with Github Copilot X.  There's so much innovation to be had there.

Anyway, going to keep working on this project to summarize the Kafka codebase with GPT-4.  Excited to finish it soon!
