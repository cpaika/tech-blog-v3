So many disorders are likely manifestations of chronic anxiety.  Anxiety is the body’s response to fear.  Fear is inherently related to loss, failure, rejection, scarcity, death.

For me, this has manifested the most in attention problems, which has impacted every aspect of my work.  It’s hard to make progress on a challenging problem if your attention keeps moving off of it every 3 minutes.  

It’s hard to enjoy your work when you feel anxious about your performance, your place in the social hierarchy, etc.

Finding this fear alone has been creating a profound change in my life.  No idea how to address it, but I have faith that I will.  I believe that finding and addressing this anxiety will be the most profound improvements in my productivity of the last decade.
