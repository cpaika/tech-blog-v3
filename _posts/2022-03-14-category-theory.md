This is the start of my project to read various Scala books, take notes, and publish them online.

### Category Theory For Programmers: Introduction

Right out the gate, I can tell this is going to be a challenging, yet rewarding book.  The author clearly put a lot of effort into making the material approachable, but there’s only so much you can do.  Math is math.

The author makes an interesting point that functional programming is much closer to math than most imperative languages.  This makes intuitive sense to me, and definitely helps to explain why getting over the functional hump was so daunting.  

He discusses how composition in math and programming is right to left - g(f(a)).  An interesting thing I’ve never thought of before.

Apparently there’s a `compose` keyword in Scala.  It’s crazy how much there is still to learn.
