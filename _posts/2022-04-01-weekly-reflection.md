This was a tough week.  Learning new things at work has been fun - it really has - but nonetheless stressful.  I'm very glad to be finished with my last project.  I've done an okay job at relaxing - I focused a lot on reading, when I should of been writing more it does a much better job of relaxing me.

I did my 5 days of pushups which was a huge win - I'm feeling great.  Been drinking plenty of water and eating pretty healthy.

My focus was off.  Towards the end of the week I was better about putting my phone away, but there's no way around it - I could've been more deliberate with my attention.  It's much better than it used to be, so I know I'm going to improve next week.

While I wouldn't say I'm energized about my current project, I'm definetly enjoying it.  I learned a lot of new Scala concepts (methods vs functions, function currying, statefulMapConcat).  The `Category Theory` book has hugely paid off, already the Scala type system is making so much more sense.

So I'm off to a fun weekend of boating with family.  Next week I'm on vacation, and the week after Colorado!  Lot's of things to do, I'm grateful for it.
