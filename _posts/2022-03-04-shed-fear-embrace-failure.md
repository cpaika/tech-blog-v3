For my entire life I felt like something was missing.  Is it that I don't click with my friends?  Is it my city?  What about my job?

Recently decided to go an internet conference - think burning man, but for incredibly online people.  I was incredibly excited for the opportunity to meet and talk to people with a bunch of interesting backgrounds.

Then - an injury happened.  Skiing through some glades, fell over and whacked my head on a log.  Helmet meant it didn't feel like much at the time, but I gave myself a concussion.  Nothing too serious, but enough that I wasn't able to travel.  

I had to cancel my conference plans and I was so incredibly sad.  Why was I so sad?

Because, I was excited to be a leach.  I've always been a lurker.  I love to take advantage of things, people and experiences.  I hate to create them.

I hate to create them because I'm scared! Scared I'll fail.  I'll organize a party and it won't be fun.  No one will come.  Everyone will think I'm stupid.

There's a wonderful world, right here where you are, when you life the vail of fear off of your eyes.

Failures will happen.  Failures should be **celebrated**, I don't care if it's cringe to say it.  If you're too scared to try and create things, you'll always remain a lurker. 

So of course a party of interesting people sounded great to me - I could go leach off these other people!  Maybe I'd become like them.  Maybe they are what I was missing.

None of these people will solve the hole in my life.  Mentor's exist, but they can't do the work for you.  I need to go off into the world, shed my fear, and become the interesting person I feel like I'm missing.
