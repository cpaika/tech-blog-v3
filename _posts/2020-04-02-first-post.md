Welcome to the third revision of my technical blog.  The first was long lost to time, and the second was an ill fated self hosted Wordpress site.  The goal is that this will last for a decade.

I'll be writing about all the things I'm interested in - engineering productivity, infrastructure, backend engineering, and of course personal productivity systems!

I'm making a public pledge - I'm aiming to write 20 blog posts this year in 2020.  As I'm quarantined now that coronavirus is in full swing - I'm hoping I'll have plenty of time to write.
