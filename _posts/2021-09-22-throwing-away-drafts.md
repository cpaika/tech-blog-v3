Sometimes when I write I get incredibly excited by a topic, rushing head first into it.  If I'm lucky a blog post comes out of it - writing and publishing brings me an implicit joy.  I don't really care if anyone reads what I write, I just like putting something out in the world.

If I'm unlucky though, I get myself into a situation.  Maybe the topic is far larger than I'm ready to handle - or maybe it's so small it's not worth mentioning.  In a situation like that, the key thing to realize is that it's okay to shelve a bad draft.  Maybe you come back to it - and maybe you don't.  Putting something aside is a failure sure, but a failure that you learn from.  By putting something that isn't working aside, you're freeing youself up to find something that does work.  Life and writing are all about exploration and play, and play requires failure.

There must be some rule on how long it takes for a blog to devolve into giving writing advice...
