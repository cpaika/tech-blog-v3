I'm at 1:09 on this video: [The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=1&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy).  Wow, Andrej is an incredible teacher.  He moves very fast, and doesn't make it particularly easy to follow along.  1 hour of his video took me about 2 hours to get through, taking notes, doing it on my end.

But there's no way around it - he's teaching this stuff directly from first principles in a really powerful way that I appreciate. Excited to continue and start to get my hands dirty with actual examples once this video is over.
