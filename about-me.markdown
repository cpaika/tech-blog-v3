I'm Chris Paika - I'm a Software Engineer in Boston who can never quite nail down what role I want to identify with (Backend? Infrastructure? SRE?).

I'm currently working at Constant Contact, on increasing the productivity of our engineering organization by providing a platform and tools to develop and deploy backend applications easily.

My email address is paika.christopher@gmail.com - I'm happy to get email from you - see my [Standing Invitation](/standing-invitation/)

**Isn't it a bit egotistical for your blog title to be your last name?** Starting sometime as a teenaged, 'Paika' became a nickname for me.  It followed me to college, and after a few years in the workforce of miraculously being called 'Chris' again, someone started calling me Paika and once again it stuck.  When naming the blog I figured I'd lean into the nickname since it's apparently not going away!
