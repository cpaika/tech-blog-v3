I'm Chris Paika - I work as a software engineer at Tesla Energy, working on the cloud platform that ingests telemetry from our fleet of Powerwalls and Megapacks. 

For personal interests, these are the categories of things that I find value in again and again:
* Family
* Meditation
* Reading (of course!)
* Rationalism and the LessWrong community
* Cryptocurrency
* Nutrition
* Exercise
* Water - boating, SCUBA, any water sport really
* Investing

My email address is paika.christopher@gmail.com. I'm always happy to get email and meet knew people - see my [Standing Invitation](/standing-invitation/)

**Isn't it a bit weird for your blog title to be your last name?** Starting sometime as a teenager 'Paika' became a nickname for me.  It followed me to college, and after a few years in the workforce of miraculously being called 'Chris' again, someone started calling me Paika and once again it stuck.  When naming the blog I figured I'd lean into the nickname since it's apparently not going away!
