I'm Chris Paika - I'm a Software Engineer in Boston who can never quite nail down what role I want to identify with (Backend? Infrastructure? SRE?).

I'm currently working at Constant Contact, on increasing the productivity of our engineering organization by providing a platform and tools to develop and deploy backend applications easily.

My email address is paika.christopher@gmail.com - I'm happy to get email from you - see my [Standing Invitation](/standing-invitation/)
