# Current Projects ðŸŒ±
#### Writing
My current stretch goal is to hit 50,000 words published on this blog in 2021.  I'm currently at {% posts_word_count total %} words total.

#### Learning Golang
To stay up to date with the industry and contribute in the [Cloud Native Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) open source ecosystem, I've started to learn the Go programming language.
To start I picked up a (physical!) copy of the highly recommend ["The Go Programming Language"](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440)

Currently I'm going through the exercises, chapter by chapter.  You can see my progress through the exercises [on my github repo](https://github.com/cpaika/the-go-programming-language)

#### Calendar Calculator
A golang utility that reads your google calendar and lets you know how many meetings you've had over different periods of time.
[Check it out here](https://github.com/cpaika/calcalc)

# Finished Projects ðŸŒ³
#### Gravity Game
A little game I used to try out webpack. Add planets to the field and watch them all interact with each other gravitationally. [Click here to try it out](https://cpaika.github.io/gravity-game/)
