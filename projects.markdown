# Current Projects ðŸŒ±
#### Writing
I've always enjoyed blogging here, as well as writing on twitter.  I'm slowly working on a personal book, about myself for an audience of one.

#### Learning Scala
I'm currently working through Category Theory For Programmers by Bartosz Milewski.  So far it's a great book and I believe it will really increase my ability to write good functional Scala.

# Abandoned Projects ðŸ§Ÿ
#### Learning Golang
*Status: No reason to learn Golang - I'm learning Scala for work!*

To stay up to date with the industry and contribute in the [Cloud Native Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) open source ecosystem, I've started to learn the Go programming language.
To start I picked up a (physical!) copy of the highly recommend ["The Go Programming Language"](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440)

Currently I'm going through the exercises, chapter by chapter.  You can see my progress through the exercises [on my github repo](https://github.com/cpaika/the-go-programming-language)

#### Calendar Calculator
*Status: Would love to come back to this someday!*

A golang utility that reads your google calendar and lets you know how many meetings you've had over different periods of time.
[Check it out here](https://github.com/cpaika/calcalc)

# Finished Projects ðŸŒ³
#### Gravity Game
A little game I used to try out webpack. Add planets to the field and watch them all interact with each other gravitationally. [Click here to try it out](https://cpaika.github.io/gravity-game/)
