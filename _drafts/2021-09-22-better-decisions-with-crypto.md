Like any new technology, there is a lot of hype and scams down the cryptocurrency rabbit hole.  But there's also a lot of groundbreaking technology.  In many ways, I'm a true believer - I think it's likely that Bitcoin will replace gold as the worlds effective reserve currency and radically change the world.  

Money's interesting (*incredibly* interesting) - however it's interesting to think about where crypto can be applied outside of money.  It's a new technology, who knows what it can do!  So here's a though experiment, on potential ways we apply crypto to create better forms of organizations, specifically for profit corporations engineering departments as that's where my focus has been for the past few years.

## Current state of the art
Human beings are obviously incredibly intelligent.  We can form groups, and in those groups we develop culture - a shared set of stories and norms that guides how individuals in the group behave.  Bonding together, humans become more than the some of their parts.  We've evolved to work together great in small groups - however we have far less evolutionary experience working together on a larger scale.  

To be blunt - we suck at making decisions at a large scale.  Once a company grows beyond say, 1000 people, all sorts of inefficiences are introduced.  If there isn't a strong leader present who can optimize the system, ineffeciences can expand to the point where the company itself loses it's market and dies.  I've seen it happen.  So the question is - how do we make an organization get smarter as people are added, rather than dumber? This is the one of the core questions [Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://civilizationemerging.com/) explores, and I'm going to explore here.

We should also have a brief overview of your average corporate structure.  

You'll first have a board of director's, elected by the shareholders to steward the company.  That means firing a CEO if they're doing a bad job, hiring a replacement, or approving major strategic decisions.

From there on you'll have the CEO - who is legally obligated to "maximize shareholder value", a quite nebulous term.  In reality, they serve many roles.  A good CEO functions in three roles:
1.  Sets and adjusts the vision for the company (aka the journey)
1.  Turns the vision into a story to convince the members of the company it's worthwhile
1.  Decides on and guides the execution of the vision

Below the CEO you have leadership - generally VP level execs, who are given responsibilities in certain constrained domains (Sales, Engineering, Marketing, Product) to execute on.  They're job is judged by the CEO and various metrics they decide on.  Often these executives and departments come in to conflict with each other.

Below leadership you have managers in each of the VP's silos.  Domains are broken down even further, usually by product type, and delegated to managers.

A good manager understands that the name itself is an antipattern - and guides the team underneath them rather than "managing" them.  The team underneath a manager is usually 4-10 people, composed of various complementary skills needed to attack the problem at hand.  Due to some reality of the human brain, 4-10 people seems to be the sweet spot for a team size.  Any more and the team will start to naturally subdivide itself into cliques. 

## Problems with the corporate structure

###  Old
It's hard to know what, if anything is wrong with your classic corporate structure.  It definetly feels archaic.  The webs of trust tend to go from the top down - with most conversation happening virtually during the pandemic, it would be incredibly interesting to map the communication channels of a company.  My guess would be it would be very tree like - groups talk, and groups underneath members of groups talk and so forth.  This communication pattern has been referred to as 'Information Silos' for whatever reason, with it being difficult to transmit plans and ideas across one section of the tree to another.

If only we had some magical company IQ metric (CQ), that could tell us which companies were 'smart' and which weren't.  We could measure companies, and look at the common attributes of high CQ companies to understand how their structure allowed them to make better decisions.  However there isn't - we can pay college students to take IQ tests, but we don't have a way to test the intelligence of a corporation.  Your average corporation probably isn't interested in going through a company wide experiment, when they're already trying to do as much as they can to survive in the market.

Also, there's been so many changes with communication technology in the last 50 years.  Sure email and chat have changed how people communicate, and excel sheets have given us more data informed decisions but I'd bet things are very similar.  Put someone from a company 50 years ago in a company today, and I doubt they'd notice the decision making process was that different. 

While corporations get a bad rap for being cutt-throat, unfortunately I'm going to take the controversial approach that in general they are too empathetic.  (include this?)


## Interesting questions
Why are countries run so differently than corporations?  The simple answer - corporations can fail, countries cannot.  If a corporation fails, some supply problems may happen and some people will lose their jobs.  If a country fails, there is anarchy in the streets and somebody is going to step into that power vacuum.  Hopefully they agree with all of your values.

We want an incredibly stable monopoly on violence, that get's out of the way and leaves us our individual freedoms.  However those individual freedoms are enforced by culture.  


### Crypto:
So can crypto fundamentally disrupt how we run corporations?  They can certainly avoid taxes.  

To improve companies, we'd have to improve the information flow.  One way to do this would be by quantifying status.

Companies currently quantify status by job title - however that's likely far too coarse grained.  If you have four software engineer titles, being title #3 tells me you're likely good at being a software engineer.  It tells me less about your opinions on product design or marketing.  

If we want information to flow freely, we need less structure.
