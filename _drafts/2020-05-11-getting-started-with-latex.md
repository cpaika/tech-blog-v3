I was recently putting together a plan to reduce costs in an AWS account at work.  I was writing it in Notion, and for fun defined the cost equations in the LaTex block Notion provides.  Go figure, it was surprisingly fun.  While I've always though of LaTex as a bit frivolous, it was actually quite satisfying to use!

After getting a taste, I stumbled on a link to a Spring Textbooks Covid-19 giveaway.  I grabbed a copy of [Latex in 24 hours](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319478302) and begin to research.

Tex was developed by Donald Knuth.  
For that, he's known as the [Patron Saint of Yak Shavers](https://yakshav.es/the-patron-saint-of-yakshaves/)
