On the path to becoming a senior engineer, I found myself spending increasing portions of my time mentoring junior engineers.  Mentoring takes many forms - sometimes its formal 1x1's, sometimes a quick pair programming session, and other times just a casual conversation.

At some point, I realized I had been mentoring new engineers *a lot.*  It didn't just happen by chance - I was really enjoying it.  I love helping people, and seeing them grow.  However I'm not a manager, and have no plans to be one.

What I realized was being an IC and mentoring others is the perfect situation for me.  I get to help others, while not having to deal with all the trouble managing brings, and still having time or technical work.  As I focused on improving, here are few things I've found that have helped me be a better mentor.

## Default to Sponsorship - Not Giving Advice

Sponsorship is where rather than give advice, you advocate for your mentee.  Definetly read [Lara Hogans]([https://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/](https://larahogan.me/blog/what-sponsorship-looks-like/)) writing on the topic as its completely reframed my approach.  You should always prioritize finding opportunities, and gently pushing your mentees into opportunities, over giving them advice.  The fastest way for anyone to grow is when they are put in an appropriately challenging situation - it's your responsibility to curate and guide them into those opportunities.  They'll gain much more confidence getting things done than they ever would hearing you talk.

## Listen more than you speak

The job of a mentor includes giving their mentee advice.  Good advice is specific, and oriented to the context of the situation.  That's why having a mentor is so rewarding - you can read all the advice you want on the internet, but most advice won't be tailored to a mentee's situation.  A good mentor can listen and understand a mentees situation, and use that to give them advice that will lead to a good outcome.  So please - if you find yourself talking to much, pause and think  of a question to ask your mentee.  The more you listen, the more you understand their context, the better advice you can give them.

## Make the first move

In m experience, most junior engineers don't reach out for help nearly as much as they should.  Some may not realize that help is an option, or others may be worried about appearing annoying.  Whatever their particular reason, as a mentor it's on you to reach out and offer help.  If you meet a new engineer whose struggling on something, schedule a 1x1 with them and listen to what's going on.  Offer to give bootcamp or new college graduates technical practice interviews.  Offer to pair with someone who seems stuck on a ticket.  And if they say no - great!  They have it handled.

## It's not about you

The only thing that matters is helping your mentee.  This means you will have to be selfless, and optimize for what's best for them even when it doesn't involve you.  Maybe you might not be in the right position to be able to offer advice to your mentee - then its best you help find them a better mentee and for you to back away.  For example - I'm a run of the mill white male in software engineering - when I mentor young women engineers, I make a point to connect them with other woman mentees.  I don't have the perspective they do - the best thing I can do for my mentee is to connect them to someone who can offer them that perspective.

## Give back to those just starting

As you get more senior, you tend to mentor those a level below - engineers who are already good developers, just not seniors yet.  You can offer them good advice, since you were just in that position, and it's rewarding, since they are past the basics and have moved on to more challenging work.

What's important is to never forget to spend some time on the engineers who are just starting their careers!  Although you haven't been in their shoes for a long time, you can always offer advice.  

## Pay attention to representation

It's an unfortunate natural tendency to want to help people who look like you.  As an established engineer, it's your job to help address the problem of underrepresentation in the tech industry.  Go out of your way to help mentor people who are underrepresented in the tech industry.  If you happen to be based in the Boston area, [Resilient Coders]([http://www.resilientcoders.org/](http://www.resilientcoders.org/)) is an excellent way to help new engineers get started.

## Don't forget to be their friend

When mentoring, it can be easy to just focus on talking about your mentees career.  Before you know it, you've spent months talking through work and realize you don't know much about them as a person.  Make sure you spend time getting to know them and becoming friends.  It builds trust, and will make sure you stay in touch over the years and get to see them grow.

## Be Honest & Vulnerable

Good mentorship is built on trust - and the way to build trust is by being honest with your mentee.  For example - as someone who has slowly gotten over Imposter Syndrome, I'm honest with my mentees about how I've often felt like I wasn't a good programer in the past.  By opening up to them, it helps them to feel comfortable sharing any insecurities with me so we can work on addressing them together.

Mentoring others and seeing them grow is an incredibly valuable work.  I hope you find as much fulfillment out of it as I do!
