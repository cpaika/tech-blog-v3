2020 was a big year for me.  We all lived through it - I don't need to tell you about it.  If you want a recap, you can watch the mildly funny, mostly boring mockumentary [Death to 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_to_2020).

While bloggers writing about there year has to be a trope by now, it's a trope for a reason.  Reflection is an excellent tool for implementing positive change, and there's no better way for you to think than by writing.  I highly recommend that you too start a yearly review!

### Looking Back
While everything in the world was awful, I was exceptionally lucky to be able to use the solitude of the year to make some real progress in my life.

I started the year quite burnt out - I spent most of 2019 trying to start a new team to improve engineering productivity at my last company.  While the experience was formative, trying to start a new team as an engineer without any real executive support was difficult to say the least.  But, as the Stoics say, "[The Obstacle is the Way](https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/1591846358)".  I spent the majority of my professional time this year on this team - recruiting and growing the team, orienting the team to the problem space I was seeing, and guiding the implementation of a Kubernetes platform.  

There were a lot of highlights + Luis

On a personal note - this year was also pretty awesome.  During our quarantine my partner and I fostered dogs - while it was exhausting it was incredibly rewarding, and a great experience while everything else in the world sucked.

We bought kayaks from REI, and spent a great amount of time on the water exploring around Boston and Cape Cod.  I definetly want to do more of this in 2021.

My best purchase of the year was my [Kindle Oasis](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Oasis-now-with-adjustable-warm-light/dp/B07F7TLZF4).  I had been running out of space on my bookshelf, and started reading on my iPad instead.  After trying to read it outside in the sun, I gave my partner's Kindle a try, bought my own and haven't looked back since.  Unless you are willing to fiddle with a [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) installation , it requires you to buy all of your eBooks through Amazon - but there's no good way to avoid that.  The ebook market's heavy use of DRM feels antiquated in today's age of streaming - I'm curious to see how offerings like Kindle Unlimited disrupt the market here.

With a shiny new eReader and being stuck inside I had a lot of time to read.  I read 32 books this year - my goal was 20 so I'm quite happy with that.  As I cut down on internet usage (more on that in the next section!), I'm planning on increasing that goal this upcoming year.

Looking back on what I read, the best book has to be the [Three Body Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)) - like all great Sci-Fi, it makes you think.  A close second would be [Permutation City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_City) by Greg Egan, it's just an amazing story.  Read it.

A major mistake was not having time off at the end of the year - the holidays are stressful, and working made sense this year but hopefully is one of the last times I don't take a break.

### Looking Forward

While my podcast consumption has plumented during quarantine, I'm still a big fan of the [Cortex Podcast](https://www.relay.fm/cortex).  A habit the hosts walk listeners through is setting a [Yearly Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE), a guiding principle for your new year.  This year my theme is *'The Year of Minimalism'* (if a person decides to become a minimalist and they don't blog about it, did they actually change?). Although I've come a long way on my Konmari journey, there's a long ways to go.  There numerous papers, comic books, mementos and hobby equipment I need to sort through and discard the majority of.  A big part of this year while be making time for those things, so I can live a happier life less encombered by objects surrounding me.

I'm hoping to extend the minimalism theme to a few other areas of my life as well, simplifying my finances to start as well as a far more ambitious project we're starting to kick off later this year.  I'll write more about it as it becomes more concrete!

Reading a lot last year was such a great addition to my life, I'm doubling down.  This year I'm setting a stretch goal to read 40 books - considering how I'm starting to wean myself off frivolous internet usage, I think this will be a great way to spend my extra time.  Assuming an average book length of 90,000 words, and that my reading speed is about average at 250 words per minute, that means I need to spend 40 minutes a day reading.  A little long, but I think quite manageable if I make reading my main means of relaxation.

Engage more with family and friends.

Finally, continue writing.

Less internet crap
