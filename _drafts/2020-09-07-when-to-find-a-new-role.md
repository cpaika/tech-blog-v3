I've made a lot of mistakes at my first software job.  We all do.  Where I particularly screwed up was how long I persisted and stayed at my organization.  During the 5 years our organization went through a lot: an acquisition, two rounds of layoffs, talented senior engineers fleeing the company, the organization being switched into ['harvest mode'](https://davidcummings.org/2012/05/03/look-out-for-harvest-mode-saas-startups), our CEO and GM being charged and fined by the SEC for fraud, a failed AWS migration, and another change of leadership.

Throughout all of this, I stayed.  I commiserated with coworkers, and listened when they tried to convince me to leave.  I even took a few calls here and there from recruiters and others who left the organization.  But no matter what, I stayed.

It wasn't compensation keeping me there - unfortunately compensation increases in our industry tends to come from job changes.  It was doubt.  Every time I thought to leave, I was plagued with it.  Whether or not it was the right decision, whether or not I was missing out by leaving.  

Here are some of the doubts I had over the years, and where I've found they are wrong.  Hopefully one of them helps get you thinking

### I can't leave now - the company is improving!
If you've stayed at a company for a while during its negative downward spiral, you know that it's hard to give up.  You've invested so much time at the organization, you feel invested in it succeeding.  It's natural to get FOMO.  "What if I leave and the company begins its turnaround?" 

I've listened to this fear and stayed through the negative downward spiral all the way to the business turnaround.  **It's not worth it**.  It's a long process that takes *years*.  To be a part of it isn't a grand adventure - it's a hard slog.  In my experience the turnaround takes place by pushing engineers to push out more features.  All the technical and infrastructure debt thats holding your organization back?  Even after the turnaround you likely won't be able to tackle the majority of it.

To top it all of - during this turnaround, you won't be compensated well.  If you're unhappy with your compensation now, just wait until three years later where all your peers are earning close to a hundred grand more than you, just because you made the decision to stay.

There's no sunshine at the end of the rainbow here.  The process of turning a company around is a brutal process.  If you're not actively engaged in the process, don't commit yourself to it.  

### The acquisition won't be that bad!  The SLT is telling us it's fine
Being acquired is usually terrible.  There can be good acquisitions, however my guess is that they are few and far between.  I've yet to see one at least.

Regardless every acquisition is acompanied by the senior leadership team telling everyone how everything will be fine.  They'll do it across every communication channel possible, in person 1x1s, all hands meetings, emails.  Common refrains include:
* "The acquisition makes us stronger than before!"
* "For the vast majority of you, nothing will change"
* "They'll only be a slight consolidation of similar roles"

For the most part, these are lies.  Usually the senior leadership team of the organization being acquired are being paid a lot to reassure people.  

However watch what they say, not what they do.  Most leaders will be compelled to stay by 'golden handcuffs', and equity grant that keeps them at their role for a year to provide stability during the transition.  Afterwards they'll likely quickly leave, and poach their favorite talent along with them.

We'll leave the intricacies of the process for another time.  Take this for the sign that it is - the combined company is not going to be a place you want to work at.  Don't make my mistake - leave.

### Everyone else is leaving, I have a responsibility to stay and fix things
No, you don't.  Unless your organization is actively saving lives, or you own it, you have to keep in mind your **number one responsibility is yourself.**  You likely have a partner, family or community you want or need to provide for.  To do that well, you need to focus on making sure you:
1.  Enjoy your work
1.  Are compensated well
1.  Work reasonable hours

Your entire organization is not your responsibility.  Have the courage to change the things you can, but accept those things that you can't change (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer#:~:text=God%2C%20grant%20me%20the%20serenity,wisdom%20to%20know%20the%20difference.)  You'll have a long, tiring career if you spend it trying to fix broken organizations.  Wouldn't you rather work with others to build something great then trying to fix things that are broken?

### But the tech bubble is going to crash any moment now - what if I get laid off and can't find a job?
This plagued me during every job search - "But what if the economy crashes and I get laid off?"

This happened to a friend of mine - they left our company for a new job.  Within a few months of joining the new company Covid-19 hit, and their company laid them off.  However they talked to friends at our company, and got hired right back at a different team.  Most likely with a compensation increase!  It's so common we have a term for it, a boomerang hire.

As for me, I started my job search during the full brunt of Covid-19 in Spring 2020.  I had more recruiter calls, job leads, and opportunities than I could keep track of.

**There's always a market for good talent**.  If you know that you are good at what you do, even during a downturn there will be people who desperately want to hire you.  Don't let the fear of disaster keep you from reaching out for something more.

### But the people I work with are amazing!
I'm sure they are.  There's also amazing people at other companies.  Would you accept a job at a company where you didn't like your interviewers?  Doubtful.  Trust that you'll steer yourself towards another place with wonderful people.

### I've built so many relationships that help me get my job done.  Am I really going to throw those all away?
Yes, you will.  You've built these relationships before, and you'll build them again at a new role.

Also, you are not throwing them away!  Those relationships will last a lifetime and will be avaluable source of future job opportunities as well as referall hires for you.  Keeping in touch is easy nowadays.


### Make the choice
There are benefits to staying.  However, the opportunity costs (the loss of potential gains from alternatives) are likely far higher.
Trust your gut if its telling you to leave, and find the role that's right for you.  Our lives are finite, spend it doing something you love.
